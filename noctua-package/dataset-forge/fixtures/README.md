# Fixtures

`orders.csv` — 600 synthetic rows with planted structure, the regression test for the skill:
`total = unit_price × qty` (degree-2, SWRL-verifiable), `subtotal = total × (1 − discount_pct/100)`
(formula non-canonical for the script — the semantic channel must state it), `zip ↔ city ↔ region`
(bijective lookups, Horn), `late ⇔ delivered_days > 7` (threshold label, SWRL comparator),
`weight_kg ≈ qty × hidden unit weight` (near-collinear, NOT derivable — an honest disagreement),
`order_id` (identity), `customer_id` (foreign key), `note` (low-cardinality text).
Expected: basis of 8 named columns against an intrinsic dimension of ~7; `late` as the single
defensible label candidate with `delivered_days` in its leakage set.

`orders.geometry-layer.json` — a complete `layer-geometry-data` document for `orders.csv`, hand-authored from
`geometry.py`'s output with the planted structure above (8-member basis, two cycles with both orientations,
`weight_kg` as the disagreement, `late` as the single candidate). Symbolic provenance is `untested` throughout:
no engine was run for the fixture, and the fixture must not claim otherwise. It is the regression input for
`scripts/apply_geometry_layer.py` + `scripts/smoke_geometry.py` against any valid base model.
