# data-lens report contract — the `analysis` layer

The output file is the input model (a `/dataset-forge` `.domain.html`, with or without later layers, or the minimal base model `/data-lens --standalone` bootstraps) plus **one additive layer** named `analysis`, appended before `</body>` per domain-forge's `references/future-skills.md` layer contract. The block is written by `scripts/apply_analysis_layer.py`, which validates the data document against §1, then calls the platform writer (`domain-forge/scripts/apply_layer.py`) with this skill's shipped `assets/analysis-render.js` and `assets/analysis-layer.css`, and adds a `<noscript>` fallback (the findings list, the evidence tables, the transcript). The render mounts one tab, `data-layer="analysis"`, labelled **Analysis**, as a `section.tab-pane` next to the host's tabs (the convention `/dataset-forge` and `/inferred-questions` use); it reads only `layer-analysis-data`, is idempotent, and renders an explanatory empty state when the data script is missing. It never touches the base runtime or earlier layers. The analyst authors the JSON; nobody authors the JavaScript per run.

```html
<!-- @LAYER:start analysis v1
     produced-by: /data-lens
     produced-at: <UTC ISO timestamp>
     input-digest: sha256:<digest of the canonical Turtle script>

<script id="layer-analysis-data" type="application/json"> { ...schema below... } </script>
<script id="layer-analysis-render" type="text/javascript"> (function(){ ... })(); </script>
<style id="layer-analysis-style"> .layer-analysis ... </style>
<!-- @LAYER:end analysis -->
```

A `--continue` run replaces the `analysis` layer (the platform writer strips the same-named layer and reports it): the base model and every *other* layer are preserved byte-for-byte, the previous file stays on disk as the record of the previous session, and the new layer carries the old turns plus the new ones.

## 1. `layer-analysis-data` schema

The analyst authors the judgement and never retypes a number. A layer document may carry

```json
{ "from_analysis": "<run-dir>/analysis.json", "context": { "reading": "…" }, "findings": [ … ] }
```

and `scripts/apply_analysis_layer.py` splices in, from that file: `source` (path, rows, columns,
seed, geometry), `context` (typing, basis, derivations, partition, time, spatial — the author's
`reading` is kept), every module's `ran` / `skipped_because` / `evidence` (the author's `reading`
is kept), and the SVG of every figure the engine drew, read from its `path` on disk. A figure may
also be given inline as `svg`, or as a `path` to an `.svg` file. What follows is the shape of the
spliced result — the document the apply script validates and writes.

Required keys (the apply script refuses without them): `schema`, `source` (with `path`, `geometry`, `seed`), `context` (with `typing`, `basis`, `partition`), `modules` (every module key present, each with `ran` and, when `ran` is false, `skipped_because`), `findings`, `transcript`, `handoff` (with `shaper_candidates`, an array that may be empty, in application order). `context.typing[].type` is the geometry layer's `final_type` and `role` its `role`, copied; the enumeration is the one `dataset-forge/references/report-contract.md` §1 defines. Datetime and coordinate columns are not roles: they are `context.time` and `context.spatial`, detected here. Transformation-candidate ids (`T<n>`) are unique across the whole layer (findings and turns together), so `handoff.shaper_candidates` resolves without a finding id; a candidate born in a turn is cited by `/dataset-shaper` as `analysis:turn<N>/T<m>`, one born in a finding as `analysis:F<n>/T<m>`. Each finding needs `id`, `module`, `severity`, `title`, `columns`, `evidence`, `method` (with `assumptions_checked` in `{passed, violated, n/a}`), `reading`, `so_what`; a finding whose `method` reports a p-value must also carry an `effect` entry in `evidence` and a `correction` entry in `method` (or `correction: "none — single pre-registered test"`). Each transcript turn needs `question`, `code`, `result`, `answer`, `grounded`; a turn with `grounded: false` has `code: null`, `result: null` and an `answer` that names the gap. Every `transformation_candidates[].op` must be a step name from `dataset-shaper/references/step-catalog.md` when that skill is installed, otherwise a free-form op with `"catalog": "none"`. Optional: `figures` (svg strings ≤ 120 KB each, render ≤ 1.5 MB total), `stances` (structured as above — `kind`, `columns`, `assertion`, `source` — so `/dataset-shaper` can check a step against them mechanically), `context.spatial` and `context.time` (absent or empty mean the same: not detected).

## 2. The admission rule for a finding

An observation becomes a finding only if it passes the **decision test**: it changes something downstream — a preprocessing step, a modeling choice, a data-collection question, or the reading of a result. `describe()` and `corr()` output is *evidence*, filed under `modules.*.evidence`; it is never a finding by itself. "Mean unit_price is 41.2" is evidence; "unit_price is bimodal with modes at 12 and 88 that coincide with two product families, so a single scaling decision misrepresents both" is a finding, and its `so_what` says what to do.

Two rules bind every finding that rests on a statistical test: the **assumption check comes before the p-value** (normality, homoscedasticity, independence, expected counts — checked by the script, reported as `passed` or `violated`, and a violation routes to the robust or non-parametric alternative rather than being noted and ignored), and **a p-value never travels alone** — it carries an effect size with its confidence interval and the multiple-comparison correction applied across the family it belongs to. Causal language ("X causes Y", "the effect of X") is not admitted on observational data; the finding says *associated*, and the `caveats` say why.

## 3. Modules — what each computes and what the analyst reads

The script computes; the analyst reads and admits. Each module's `evidence` is copied verbatim from `analysis.json`; each `reading` is prose per §5.

| module | computes (script) | the analyst decides |
|---|---|---|
| `quality` | missing rate per column and its dependence on other columns, duplicate rows and near-duplicates on the basis, constant / quasi-constant columns, cardinality, type coherence (mixed types, numerics stored as text, dates that do not parse), unit and range anomalies (negative counts, percentages above 100), inconsistent categories (case, whitespace) | which missingness mechanism is plausible (MCAR / MAR / MNAR) and what imputation follows; which anomalies are errors and which are the phenomenon |
| `distributions` | moments, quantiles, skew and kurtosis, normality (Shapiro on ≤ 5000 rows, otherwise D'Agostino), modality hint (KDE peaks), outliers by IQR, MAD and isolation forest with agreement counts, zero-inflation, nominal entropy and long-tail share | whether a transformation (log / Box-Cox / Yeo-Johnson) is warranted, whether outliers are genuine, which columns need a per-group reading |
| `relations` | robust correlations (Spearman, Kendall) among basis numerics, partial correlations controlling for the other basis members, mutual information, interaction screen on the label (pairwise product terms), VIF | which associations are new relative to the geometry layer's orthogonality report (that report is the baseline; this module reads *residual* structure only) |
| `inference` | group comparisons for every nominal × numeric pair with ≤ 12 groups: Welch ANOVA or Kruskal per the assumption check, ω² / ε² effect sizes, pairwise contrasts with Holm; nominal × nominal chi-square with Cramér's V; bootstrap CIs for the differences that matter; BH correction across the family; a nominal column with more than 12 groups is not tested, and the module's reading says which columns the cap excluded and why, so a silent omission never reads as a null result | which contrasts are practically relevant (effect size), not only significant; which tests were pre-declared by the user's question and which were exploratory |
| `segments` | k-means and agglomerative scans on the standardized basis (k = 2..8) with silhouette and stability under resampling; per-segment profiles | whether segments are real or an artefact of scaling; what each segment *is* in the dataset's own terms |
| `importance` | only with a chosen partition (`context.partition.label` not null; otherwise `ran: false, skipped_because: "no partition chosen"`): a baseline model (regularized linear + gradient boosting), stratified CV score with CI, permutation importance, learning curve, a leakage probe (any feature with importance that collapses when the geometry derivations of the label are removed) | whether the task is learnable at all from the basis, which features carry it, whether an importance is leakage in disguise |
| `time_series` | only with a datetime column: regularity, gaps, trend (Theil–Sen), seasonality (STL by the detected period), ACF/PACF, stationarity (ADF and KPSS together), change points | what the temporal structure implies for splitting (time-based, never random) and for features (lags, calendar) |
| `spatial` | only with a coordinate pair or a geometry column (an address column is text, not a location — it becomes a location only if the user supplies coordinates): CRS sanity (range check, axis order), duplicate locations, spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I on the numeric basis), nearest-neighbour distances, clustering of points (DBSCAN in metres after projection) | whether location carries signal, which spatial features are worth deriving, whether the CRS is known enough to reproject |
| `drift` | only with a split column or `--split`: per-column distribution distance between splits (PSI, KS, Cramér's V), label-rate difference | whether the split is representative, which columns drift and why |

A module that cannot run says so (`ran: false`, `skipped_because`) — an empty module is a statement, not an omission.

## 4. The transformation candidate

A finding may propose what to *do*; it never does it. The candidate is a step in `dataset-shaper`'s recipe vocabulary (`op`, `columns`, `params`) with its `rationale` pointing back at the finding, and `alternatives` the analyst actually weighed with the condition under which each would be preferred. `/dataset-shaper` reads `handoff.shaper_candidates` in order, treats each as a proposed step whose `source` is `analysis:F<n>/T<m>` (or `analysis:turn<N>/T<m>`), and asks the user (or, unattended, applies the default) — so the candidate must be concrete enough to execute without re-analysis: named columns, named strategy, named parameters.

## 5. Narrative register

The same five rules as `dataset-forge/references/report-contract.md` §4, restated so this file stands alone: **motive before mechanism** (a test is introduced by the question it answers), **connected paragraphs**, **no argument in bullets** (lists are for enumerable material), **length follows substance** (a module with nothing to say says so in one sentence), **terms defined in flow** (effect size, MAR, PSI, silhouette — defined the first time each appears, inside the sentence). The `context.reading` opens the tab by recalling what the geometry layer settled; each module's reading closes by handing off to the question the next module answers; the findings are the tab's headline, ordered by severity.

## 6. The dialogue turn

A turn is the unit of the interactive session. It is **reproducible** (the `code` field is the exact Python `scripts/cell.py` executed, and the rendered turn carries a *re-run* button that shows the stored code and result — the page cannot execute Python, so the button re-displays, and the transcript's determinism is guaranteed by the seed recorded in `source`), **grounded** (the `answer` is composed from `result`; a turn the analyst could not execute is `grounded: false` with the gap named), and **methodical** (`method.name` and `assumptions_checked` are filled even for a one-line lookup — "n/a" is an honest value). A turn may promote its result to a finding (`finding_ref`) or attach transformation candidates (ids unique across the layer); a turn may record a user stance (`stances`, structured) that later runs and `/dataset-shaper` honour.

## 7. The renderer (inside the Analysis tab)

`assets/analysis-render.js` is a fixed asset of this skill, checked once by `scripts/smoke_analysis.py`, injected by `apply_analysis_layer.py`; a run never regenerates it. It draws from `layer-analysis-data` alone, no libraries, no network:

- **Findings board** — severity-ordered cards; each opens to evidence, method with the assumption verdict, `so_what`, the linked figures, and the transformation candidates with a "hand to /dataset-shaper" note (the layer cannot write files).
- **Module panels** — one collapsible panel per module: the reading first, then the evidence tables (sortable), then the figures; a skipped module shows its reason.
- **Transcript** — the turns in order with question, method badge, code (folded), result table, figure, answer, caveats, and the *re-run* (re-display) button; an ungrounded turn is visibly marked.
- **Context strip** — what came from the geometry layer (basis, partition, leakage) as read-only chips, so the reader sees the baseline the analysis assumes.

Constraints: render script ≤ 60 KB; figures are inline SVG strings from the layer (the script never draws data charts itself — the Python side draws them under the `dataviz` skill's conventions when that skill is installed, otherwise matplotlib defaults with a restrained palette); keyboard-operable; `<noscript>` fallback carries findings, evidence tables and transcript; the render never mutates `layer-analysis-data` or earlier layers; for tests it exposes `window.__analysis = { findings(), turns(), version }` and nothing else.
